#                                                                 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the price of second-hand cars using Machine Learning models.  
It includes:-
**data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment** with a **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.

## ⚙️ Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw car dataset (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing car prices.
- Trained multiple ML models (**Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble methods**).
- Optimized model using hyperparameter tuning & cross-validation.
- Evaluated using metrics: **RMSE, MAE**.
- Deployed using **Streamlit** for an interactive web app.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset (`Cardetails.csv`) contains features such as:
- Car brand, year, mileage, engine, max power, seats
- Fuel type, seller type, transmission
- Kilometers driven, ownership details

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing & analysis  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning models  
- **Streamlit** – Web app deployment  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
